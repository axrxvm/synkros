## üîê Security Features

### End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

Synkros implements **true end-to-end encryption** using **AES-256-GCM encryption**:

- **Client-Side Encryption**: Files are encrypted in your browser before upload using the Web Crypto API
- **Unique Keys**: Each file gets its own randomly generated 256-bit encryption key
- **Key in URL Fragment**: The encryption key is embedded in the download URL fragment (`#key`) and never sent to the server
- **Server-Side Blind**: The server stores only encrypted data and cannot decrypt files without the key
- **Client-Side Decryption**: Files are decrypted in the recipient's browser when downloaded

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

- **Encryption keys are never stored on the server** ‚Äî access is only possible with the complete share link
- **Server cannot decrypt files** ‚Äî even with full server access, files remain encrypted
- **No cookies, no analytics, no logs** (minimal access/error logs for maintenance only)
- **Auto-deletion** of all uploads after 24 hours
- Built with a **true zero-knowledge approach**:
  > If someone asks us what you uploaded, we literally couldn't tell them even if we wanted to.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Configuration

For self-hosting or development, this application requires certain environment variables to be set. These are managed in a `.env` file in the root of the project.

1.  **Create the `.env` file**: If you don't already have one, create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can do this by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Set Essential Variables**: Open your `.env` file and configure the following:
    *   `MONGODB_CONNECTION_URL`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    *   `APP_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
    *   `PORT`: The port the application should run on (e.g., `3000`).
    *   ~~`KEY`: No longer needed - E2EE encryption keys are generated client-side~~
    *   `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `MAIL_USER`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`: For email sending functionality.
    *   `CLEANUP_CODE`: A secret code for triggering the cleanup job manually via an API endpoint if needed.
    *   `ALLOWED_CLIENTS`: Comma-separated list of client URLs allowed to access the API (CORS).

**Important**: Keep your `.env` file secure and out of version control. The `.gitignore` file should already be configured to ignore `.env`.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Self-Hosting / Development)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/axrxvm/synkros.git 
    cd synkros
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment:**
    Create and configure your `.env` file as described in the "Environment Configuration" section above. Note: The `KEY` variable is no longer needed as encryption is handled client-side.
4.  **Run the application:**
    *   For development with auto-reloading:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   For production:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    The server should now be running on the `PORT` specified in your `.env` file.
