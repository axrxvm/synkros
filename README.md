## 🔐 Security Features

### File Encryption

All files uploaded to Synkros are encrypted at rest on the server using **AES-256-CBC encryption**. When a file is requested for download, it is decrypted on the server before being sent to the recipient. This ensures that your file contents remain private even if the underlying storage is directly accessed. The encryption and decryption processes require a secret `KEY` configured on the server and are handled automatically.

### Other Security Measures

- **File keys are never stored (for client-side encryption model)** — access is only possible with the share link. *Note: Currently, server-side encryption relies on a server-managed key.*
- **No cookies, no analytics, no logs** (relevant access/error logs for maintenance are minimal).
- **Auto-deletion** of all uploads after 24 hours.
- Built with a **zero-knowledge approach aspiration**:
  > If someone asks us what you uploaded, we literally couldn't tell them.

## 🛠️ Environment Configuration

For self-hosting or development, this application requires certain environment variables to be set. These are managed in a `.env` file in the root of the project.

1.  **Create the `.env` file**: If you don't already have one, create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can do this by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Set Essential Variables**: Open your `.env` file and configure the following:
    *   `MONGODB_CONNECTION_URL`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    *   `APP_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
    *   `PORT`: The port the application should run on (e.g., `3000`).
    *   `KEY`: This key is crucial for securing uploaded files using AES-256 encryption.
        *   **Format**: The `KEY` must be a string that is exactly 32 bytes (256 bits) long.
        *   **Example**: `KEY=MySuperSecretEncryptionKey123456` (Replace with your own strong key)
        *   **Generating a Key**: You can use a strong random string generator to create a suitable key. Ensure it meets the 32-byte length requirement. *For example, in Node.js: `require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex')` (use the first 32 characters of the hex output or ensure the resulting string is 32 bytes).*
    *   `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `MAIL_USER`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`: For email sending functionality.
    *   `CLEANUP_CODE`: A secret code for triggering the cleanup job manually via an API endpoint if needed.
    *   `ALLOWED_CLIENTS`: Comma-separated list of client URLs allowed to access the API (CORS).

**Important**: Keep your `.env` file (and especially the `KEY` and database credentials) secure and out of version control. The `.gitignore` file should already be configured to ignore `.env`.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Self-Hosting / Development)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/synkros.git 
    cd synkros
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment:**
    Create and configure your `.env` file as described in the "Environment Configuration" section above. Ensure `KEY` is set for encryption.
4.  **Run the application:**
    *   For development with auto-reloading:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   For production:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    The server should now be running on the `PORT` specified in your `.env` file.
