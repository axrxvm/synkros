## 🧭 Overview

**Synkros** is a no-nonsense, privacy-first file sharing web app designed for **speed, simplicity, and security**.  
No ads. No accounts. No tracking. Just encrypted, temporary file sharing that works.

**Two ways to share:**
- **Server Mode (Upload)**: Upload encrypted files up to 500MB, auto-deleted after 24 hours
- **P2P Mode (Direct)**: Transfer unlimited file sizes directly between peers via WebRTC—files never touch our servers

Whether you're sending a project build, a resume, or a dumb meme—Synkros makes it effortless.

## 🔐 Security Features

### End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

Synkros implements **true end-to-end encryption** using **AES-256-GCM encryption** in both modes:

**Server-Based Mode (Upload):**
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Files are encrypted in your browser before upload using the Web Crypto API
- **Web Worker Architecture**: Heavy encryption operations run in dedicated Web Workers for non-blocking performance
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time encryption/decryption progress with visual feedback
- **Memory Optimization**: Smart chunk-based processing handles large files (up to 500MB) efficiently
- **Unique Keys**: Each file gets its own randomly generated 256-bit encryption key
- **Key in URL Fragment**: The encryption key is embedded in the download URL fragment (`#key`) and never sent to the server
- **Server-Side Blind**: The server stores only encrypted data and cannot decrypt files without the key
- **Client-Side Decryption**: Files are decrypted in the recipient's browser when downloaded

**Peer-to-Peer Mode (Direct):**
- **Direct P2P Transfer**: Files transfer directly between peers via WebRTC DataChannels—never touching our servers
- **Real-Time Encryption**: Files are encrypted on-the-fly during transfer using AES-256-GCM
- **P2P Key Exchange**: Encryption keys are generated by the sender and transmitted directly to receivers via encrypted WebRTC DataChannels
- **WebRTC Security**: DataChannels use DTLS encryption by default, plus application-level AES-256-GCM on top
- **Signaling Privacy**: Our servers only see WebRTC signaling metadata (ICE candidates, SDP)—not file contents, names, or sizes
- **Room Passwords**: Optional SHA-256 hashed passwords for room access control
- **No Server Storage**: Files never touch our servers, providing maximum privacy
- **Web Worker Optimization**: Large files (>10MB) are pre-encrypted in Web Workers before P2P transfer

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

- **Encryption keys are never stored on the server** — access is only possible with the complete share link (server mode) or via direct P2P exchange (direct mode)
- **Server cannot decrypt files** — even with full server access, files remain encrypted (server mode) or never reach the server (P2P mode)
- **P2P files never touch our servers** — Direct mode transfers happen peer-to-peer via WebRTC; we only facilitate connection signaling
- **No cookies, no analytics, no logs** (minimal access/error logs for maintenance only)
- **Auto-deletion** of server uploads after 24 hours; P2P room data expires after 5 minutes
- **Bot Protection**: Cloudflare Turnstile verification without compromising privacy (IP addresses not logged)
- Built with a **true zero-knowledge approach**:
  > If someone asks us what you uploaded, we literally couldn't tell them even if we wanted to.

### Security & Privacy Features

- **Helmet.js Integration**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Dynamic nonce-based CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable allowed origins for API access
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP to prevent abuse
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Automatic redirect to secure connections in production
- **Secure Headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options (DENY), referrer policy (no-referrer), and more
- **Request Isolation**: Unique Ray ID per request for debugging without user tracking

## 🛠️ Environment Configuration

For self-hosting or development, this application requires certain environment variables to be set. These are managed in a `.env` file in the root of the project.

1.  **Create the `.env` file**: If you don't already have one, create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can do this by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Set Essential Variables**: Open your `.env` file and configure the following:
    *   `NODE_ENV`: Set to `development` or `production`
    *   `PORT`: The port the application should run on (e.g., `3000`)
    *   `APP_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
    *   `ALLOWED_CLIENTS`: Comma-separated list of client URLs allowed to access the API (CORS)
    *   `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `MAIL_USER`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`: For email sending functionality
    *   `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`: Cloudflare Turnstile credentials for bot protection
    *   `CLEANUP_CODE`: A secret code for triggering the cleanup job manually via an API endpoint
    *   `STUN_SERVERS`: (Optional) Comma-separated STUN server URLs for P2P mode (defaults to Cloudflare + Google STUN)
    *   ~~`KEY`: No longer needed - E2EE encryption keys are generated client-side~~
    *   ~~`MONGODB_CONNECTION_URL`: Not currently used - files stored locally~~

**Important**: Keep your `.env` file secure and out of version control. The `.gitignore` file should already be configured to ignore `.env`.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Self-Hosting / Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- A Cloudflare Turnstile account (for bot protection)
- SMTP server credentials (for email functionality)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/axrxvm/synkros.git 
   cd synkros
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   
   Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and configure the following required variables:
   
   ```bash
   # Server Configuration
   NODE_ENV=development          # or 'production'
   PORT=3000
   
   # Application
   APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   
   # Security & CORS (comma-separated URLs, leave empty for development)
   ALLOWED_CLIENTS=
   
   # Email Configuration (required for file sharing via email)
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.your-provider.com
   SMTP_PORT=465
   MAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
   
   # Cloudflare Turnstile (required for bot protection)
   TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your-site-key
   TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   
   # Cleanup
   CLEANUP_CODE=your-secret-cleanup-code
   
   # P2P Configuration (Optional - defaults to Cloudflare STUN with Google fallback)
   STUN_SERVERS=stun:stun.cloudflare.com:3478,stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
   ```

4. **Create required directories:**
   
   The application will auto-create these on first run, but you can create them manually:
   ```bash
   mkdir uploads
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   
   For development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   For production:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Features on First Run

- **Automatic cleanup job**: Runs on startup to remove expired files
- **Scheduled cleanup**: Automatically runs every 3 hours to clean up files older than 24 hours
- **P2P room management**: In-memory cache with 5-minute TTL for P2P signaling data
- **Security headers**: Helmet.js automatically applies security headers
- **HTTPS redirect**: Enabled in production mode

### Notes

- Files are stored locally in the `uploads/` directory (server mode only)
- P2P transfers happen directly between peers—files never touch the server
- Encryption is handled entirely client-side; no server-side key management needed
- Each server-mode file is automatically deleted after 24 hours
- P2P room data expires after 5 minutes of inactivity
