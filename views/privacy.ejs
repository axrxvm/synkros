      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--text-color-muted);">Last Updated: October 2, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Our Philosophy: Privacy by Design</h2>
      <p>Synkros ("we," "us," or "our") is built on a foundation of privacy and transparency. Our goal is to provide a secure, anonymous file-sharing service, which means we strive to collect as little data as possible. This policy details every piece of data we handle, why we need it, and how long we keep it. We believe you have a right to know exactly how your information is treated.</p>

      <h2>2. What We Collect and Why</h2>
      <p>To run our service, we temporarily handle the following data. This is not used for any other purpose, such as profiling or advertising.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Uploaded Files:</strong> We store your file's encrypted contents on our servers so that the recipient can download it. We cannot access this content due to end-to-end encryption.</li>
        <li><strong>File Metadata:</strong> We process the filename and file size to manage the upload and display its details to the recipient.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Email Addresses:</strong> If you choose to send a file via email, we use the provided address only to deliver the share link. The address is used once for this purpose and is not stored.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. What We Explicitly DO NOT Collect</h2>
      <p>We believe that if we don't have your data, it can't be stolen, demanded, or abused. Therefore, we have engineered our systems to avoid collecting any personally identifiable information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> We do not require you to sign up or create an account.</li>
        <li><strong>No IP Address Logging:</strong> Your IP address is not part of our standard logs. We do not track where you are connecting from.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cookies or Trackers:</strong> We do not use cookies, advertising trackers, or fingerprinting technologies. Your activity on our site is not monitored.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Security: How We Protect Your Data</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard security practices to protect your data during its brief time on our servers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):</strong> Your file is encrypted in your browser using AES-256-GCM, a robust, authenticated encryption algorithm. The key is generated on your device and added to the URL fragment (the part after the '#'). Since browsers do not send this fragment to servers, we never see the key and cannot decrypt your files.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport Layer Security (TLS):</strong> All communication between your device and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS, protecting data in transit from eavesdropping.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Retention: Strict and Automatic Deletion</h2>
      <p>All data associated with a file upload is automatically and permanently erased from our systems 24 hours after it was uploaded. This is an irreversible process. We do not keep backups or archives. Once a file is gone, it is gone forever.</p>

      <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
      <p>We are committed to upholding your rights under data protection laws. Here is how they apply to our service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can access your uploaded data at any time using the unique share link.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> Your data is automatically and irreversibly erased after 24 hours. There is no need to request deletion.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> Since we do not store personal data or user profiles, there is no personal data to correct. To change a file, you can simply upload a new version.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to our data processing at any time by ceasing to use our service.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Portability:</strong> You can download the file you uploaded at any time using the share link, fulfilling your right to data portability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Third-Party Services and Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your data with any third-party services for marketing or analytics. Our service is not directed at individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

      <h2>8. Abuse Prevention</h2>
      <p>To protect our service from abuse, such as illegal content distribution or denial-of-service attacks, we may need to implement temporary, targeted logging in response to a specific incident. This is an exception to our no-log policy and is done solely for the purpose of investigation and mitigation. Any logs created are isolated and deleted as soon as the investigation is complete.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. We will post any changes on this page and update the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review it periodically.</p>
