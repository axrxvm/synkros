      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 11, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Synkros ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our file-sharing service (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our Service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>File Content:</strong> The files you upload. For end-to-end encrypted files, we only store the encrypted data and do not have the ability to decrypt it. The decryption key is stored on the client-side and is never transferred to the server.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>File Metadata:</strong> This includes the original filename, file size, and timestamps related to creation and modification. This information is necessary to manage the file and display its details to the recipient.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you use our email sharing feature, we collect and store the sender's and recipient's email addresses to facilitate the delivery of the share link.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect your IP address for rate-limiting and security purposes to prevent abuse of our Service. We also collect information about your browser type and the pages you visit on our Service for analytics and to improve the user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide, operate, and maintain our Service.</li>
        <li>To process and manage file uploads and downloads.</li>
        <li>To facilitate the sharing of files via email at your request.</li>
        <li>To monitor and analyze usage to improve the Service's functionality and user experience.</li>
        <li>To prevent abuse, enforce our Terms of Service, and protect the security and integrity of our platform.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        All uploaded files and their associated metadata are automatically and permanently deleted from our servers 24 hours after they are uploaded. This is an irreversible process, and the data cannot be recovered. We do not offer long-term storage, and our Service should not be used as a backup solution.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Our Service uses end-to-end encryption for file content, which means that we do not have access to the decryption keys. The encryption and decryption processes occur on your device. All communications between your device and our servers are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties except in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, such as hosting providers and email delivery services. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, or delete your information. Since data is automatically deleted after 24 hours, the information we hold is transient. For any requests or questions about your data, please contact us.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
