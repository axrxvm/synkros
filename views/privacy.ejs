      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--text-color-muted);">Last Updated: October 2, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
      <p>Synkros ("we," "us," or "our") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we handle and why, ensuring transparency and compliance with data protection laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our guiding principle is to collect the minimum amount of information necessary to provide a secure and functional service.</p>

      <h2>2. What Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>We have engineered our systems to avoid collecting personal data wherever possible. We <strong>DO NOT</strong> collect or log:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> Your IP address is not stored in our standard operational logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal details like your name or email address to use our basic service.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking Information:</strong> We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or browser fingerprinting technologies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Information We Handle and Why</h2>
      <p>To operate the Service, we must handle certain data. This data is processed only for the legitimate purposes outlined below and is deleted automatically.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Uploaded Files:</strong> The encrypted files you upload are stored on our servers. Because we use client-side, end-to-end encryption, we have no access to the file contents. Files are automatically and permanently deleted after 24 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>File Metadata:</strong> We process non-personal metadata associated with your upload, such as the filename and file size, to manage the file and display it to the recipient. This metadata is deleted along with the file.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Email Addresses:</strong> If you use the optional feature to email a link, the recipient's email address is used solely to send the one-time email and is not stored or logged.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Abuse Logs:</strong> In response to a valid abuse report or to mitigate a direct threat to our service (e.g., a DDoS attack), we may temporarily log relevant metadata, which could include IP addresses. This data is used exclusively for the investigation and is purged upon its conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement robust technical measures to protect the data we handle. Our primary security feature is <strong>client-side, end-to-end encryption (E2EE)</strong> using the AES-256-GCM standard. The encryption key is generated in your browser and included in the URL fragment (#), which is never sent to our servers. This means we cannot decrypt your files, and only someone with the full link can access the content.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>All user files and associated metadata are permanently deleted from our servers 24 hours after they are uploaded. We do not create backups or archives. Once a file is deleted, it cannot be recovered.</p>

      <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
      <p>You have rights concerning your personal data. Given the anonymous nature of our service, exercising these rights may be limited, but we are committed to upholding them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You can access the data you've uploaded using your unique share link.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> Your data is automatically erased after 24 hours. You can effectively "erase" it sooner by not sharing the link.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to data processing by not using our Service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because we do not store personal data or user accounts, rights such as rectification or portability are generally not applicable. For specific inquiries, please contact us.</p>

      <h2>7. Third-Party Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to third parties. Our service is self-contained, and we do not use third-party analytics or advertising services.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

      <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at <strong>axrxvm@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
