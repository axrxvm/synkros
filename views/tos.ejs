      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Synkros ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, services, and applications (collectively, the "Service").

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>Synkros is a file-sharing service that allows users to upload files, share them via a unique link, and have them automatically deleted after a predetermined period. The Service features client-side, end-to-end encryption to protect user privacy, meaning we have no access to the contents of encrypted files.</p>

      <h2>3. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You are solely responsible for the content you upload and share through the Service and for your conduct while using it. You agree to use the Service in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>

      <h2>4. Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <p>You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful or prohibited purpose. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uploading, sharing, or distributing any content that is illegal, such as Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), pirated media, or materials that infringe on intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li>Distributing malware, viruses, or any other malicious code.</li>
        <li>Harassing, threatening, or defaming any person or entity.</li>
        <li>Interfering with or disrupting the integrity or performance of the Service or its infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reserve the right to remove any content and/or terminate user access for violations of these Terms without prior notice.</p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>You retain full ownership of the files and content you upload to the Service ("Your Content"). We do not claim any ownership rights to Your Content.</p>
      <p>Our Service, including our name, logo, code, and design, is the property of Synkros and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

      <h2>6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.</p>
      <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SYNKROS, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>

      <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Synkros and its affiliates from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service or your violation of these Terms.</p>

      <h2>8. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.</p>

      <h2>9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which our company is based, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising from these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration association.</p>

      <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
