      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 22, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Synkros. By accessing or using our file-sharing service (the "Service"), you ("User," "you," or "your") agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms," "Agreement," or "ToS") and our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms in their entirety, you must not use the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Synkros ("we," "us," or "our"). By clicking "I agree," uploading files, or otherwise accessing the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      
      <h3>2.1. What Synkros Does</h3>
      <p>
        Synkros is a free, privacy-focused, end-to-end encrypted file-sharing platform that offers two distinct sharing modes:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Server-Based Mode (Upload):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload files up to 500MB</li>
        <li>Files are encrypted client-side and stored on our servers for 24 hours</li>
        <li>Share files via unique, encrypted download links</li>
        <li>Optionally share files via email notifications</li>
        <li>Download files securely with client-side decryption</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Peer-to-Peer Mode (Direct):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transfer files of unlimited size directly between users</li>
        <li>Files never touch our servers—transfers happen via WebRTC peer-to-peer connections</li>
        <li>Create password-protected rooms for multiple participants (2-10 peers)</li>
        <li>Share room codes via QR codes or direct links</li>
        <li>Real-time encrypted file transfers with no server storage</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2. Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Our Service implements true end-to-end encryption in both modes:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Server-Based Mode:</strong> Files are encrypted in your browser before upload, and we do not have access to encryption keys. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We cannot decrypt, view, or access the contents of your files</li>
        <li>We cannot recover files if you lose the download link</li>
        <li>We cannot comply with requests to provide file contents, even under legal compulsion</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Peer-to-Peer Mode:</strong> Enhanced privacy through direct peer-to-peer transfers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Files transfer directly between peers via WebRTC—they never reach our servers</li>
        <li>We only facilitate connection signaling; we cannot see file contents, names, or sizes</li>
        <li>Encryption keys are generated and exchanged peer-to-peer via encrypted DataChannels</li>
        <li>Room passwords are hashed (SHA-256) and cannot be retrieved in plain text</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3. Temporary Storage and Ephemeral Data</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Synkros is designed for temporary file sharing, not permanent storage:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Server-Based Mode:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All files are automatically and permanently deleted 24 hours after upload</li>
        <li>Deletion is irreversible—files cannot be recovered once deleted</li>
        <li>We do not create backups of uploaded files</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Peer-to-Peer Mode:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Files are never stored on our servers—they transfer directly between peers</li>
        <li>Room data (signaling information) expires after 5 minutes of inactivity</li>
        <li>Once all peers disconnect, room data is immediately purged</li>
        <li>File transfers are live and real-time—there is no persistence</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Both Modes:</strong> The Service must not be used as a backup or long-term storage solution.</p>

      <h3>2.4. No Account Required</h3>
      <p>
        The Service does not require user registration or account creation. You can upload and share files anonymously without providing personal information (except optional email addresses for the sharing feature).
      </p>

      <h3>2.5. Service Availability</h3>
      <p>
        We strive to maintain high availability, but we do not guarantee that the Service will be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Available at all times or without interruption</li>
        <li>Free from errors, bugs, or security vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Compatible with all devices, browsers, or operating systems</li>
        <li>Maintained indefinitely—we reserve the right to discontinue the Service</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.4. Enforcement and Consequences</h3>
      <p>
        While our zero-knowledge architecture prevents us from viewing file contents, we may take action based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reports from users or third parties</li>
        <li>Metadata or patterns that suggest Terms violations</li>
        <li>Legal notifications or court orders</li>
        <li>Automated detection of suspicious activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we have reasonable grounds to believe you are violating these Terms, we may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove or disable access to specific files</li>
        <li>Temporarily or permanently block your access to the Service</li>
        <li>Report violations to law enforcement authorities</li>
        <li>Cooperate with legal investigations</li>
        <li>Take any other action we deem appropriate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Even if we remove access to encrypted files, we cannot decrypt them. We can only remove the encrypted blobs and associated metadata.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
      
      <h3>4.1. Your Content</h3>
      <p>
        You retain full ownership of all intellectual property rights in the content you upload to the Service. We do not claim any ownership over your files. By using the Service, you grant us only the limited rights necessary to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store your encrypted files on our servers</li>
        <li>Transmit your files when accessed via the download link</li>
        <li>Perform technical operations required to provide the Service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These rights terminate automatically when your files are deleted (after 24 hours or upon Service termination).
      </p>

      <h3>4.2. Our Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>
        The Synkros Service, including but not limited to our:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brand name, logo, and trademarks</li>
        <li>Website design and user interface</li>

        <li>Documentation and content we create</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ...is our property and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3. Open Source License</h3>

      <p>
        You may not use the code for commercial purposes without explicit permission. See our <a href="/license">License page</a> for full details.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4. Copyright Infringement</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Use our <a href="/report">Report Abuse</a> form to notify us</li>
        <li>Provide the file URL and proof of ownership/authorization</li>
        <li>We will investigate and remove infringing content when legally required</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Due to our zero-knowledge architecture, we cannot proactively detect copyright infringement—we rely on reports from rights holders.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
      
      <h3>5.1. Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains in detail how we handle your information. Key points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We collect only encrypted files (we can't decrypt them), optional email addresses, and ephemeral debugging data</li>
        <li>We do not log or store IP addresses</li>
        <li>We do not track users or build profiles</li>
        <li>All data is automatically deleted after 24 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By using the Service, you consent to the data practices described in our Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2. Your Privacy Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        While we protect your privacy, you must also protect yourself:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Protect Download Links:</strong> Anyone with the download link (including the encryption key) can decrypt and access your files. Share links only with intended recipients.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Strong Links:</strong> Download links contain the encryption key. Don't share them over insecure channels if the content is sensitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Privacy:</strong> Email is not encrypted. Email providers can see download links you share via our email feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Computers:</strong> Clear browser cache and history after using the Service on public or shared computers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Service integrates with third-party services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare Turnstile:</strong> For bot detection and CAPTCHA verification. Subject to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Providers:</strong> We use our own email service provider to send email notifications. Your email provider may process sharing notifications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are not responsible for the practices of third-party services. Their terms and privacy policies apply to their services.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h2>
      
      <h3>7.1. "As Is" Disclaimer</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT</li>
        <li>WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        You use the Service entirely at your own risk. We make no guarantees about the Service's availability, security, or performance.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2. No Recovery Guarantee</h3>
      <p>
        We expressly disclaim any warranty regarding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability to recover deleted files—deletion is permanent</li>
        <li>Data integrity—files may become corrupted</li>
        <li>Availability of files before the 24-hour expiration—system failures may occur</li>
        <li>Security against unauthorized access—while we use encryption, no system is perfectly secure</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.3. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SYNKROS, ITS OPERATORS, DEVELOPERS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY:

      </ul>
      <p>
        THIS LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE).
      </p>

      <h3>7.4. Damage Cap</h3>
      <p>
        If, despite the above limitations, we are found liable to you, our total aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of (a) $10 USD or (b) the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim (which is $0, since the Service is free).
      </p>

      <h3>7.5. Jurisdictional Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Specific Service Features</h2>
      
      <h3>13.1. File Size Limits</h3>
      <p>
        We impose file size limits to ensure fair usage and service performance. Current limits are displayed on the upload page. We reserve the right to modify these limits at any time.
      </p>

      <h3>13.2. Rate Limiting</h3>
      <p>
        To prevent abuse and ensure fair access, we implement rate limiting. Excessive requests from the same source may be temporarily blocked. This is not a violation of these Terms unless you intentionally circumvent rate limits.
      </p>

      <h3>13.3. Email Sharing Feature</h3>
      <p>
        If you use our email sharing feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You represent that you have permission to send files to the recipient's email address</li>
        <li>You agree not to use this feature for spam or unsolicited communications</li>
        <li>Email addresses are stored temporarily (24 hours) and deleted with file metadata</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for email delivery failures</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>13.4. Cloudflare Turnstile Verification</h3>
      <p>
        We use Cloudflare Turnstile to prevent bot abuse. By using the Service, you consent to this verification. If you cannot or will not complete the verification, you cannot use the Service.
      </p>

      <h3>13.5. Peer-to-Peer Mode (Direct)</h3>
      <p>
        When using the P2P mode, you acknowledge and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Connections:</strong> File transfers occur directly between your device and other peers' devices via WebRTC. We do not intermediate the transfer.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Requirements:</strong> P2P mode requires compatible network configurations. Restrictive firewalls, corporate networks, or certain NAT types may prevent connections. We do not guarantee successful P2P connections.</li>
        <li><strong>No TURN Servers:</strong> We do not provide TURN relay servers. If direct peer-to-peer connection fails, the transfer will not succeed.</li>
        <li><strong>Room Limits:</strong> Rooms support 2-10 participants. We may enforce these limits and terminate rooms that exceed capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Room Expiration:</strong> Rooms expire after 5 minutes of inactivity or when all peers disconnect. Room codes cannot be reused after expiration.</li>
        <li><strong>Password Protection:</strong> Room passwords are optional. You are responsible for sharing room credentials securely. We store only password hashes and cannot recover lost passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> Files transferred in P2P mode are never stored on our servers. We cannot recover, retrieve, or provide access to these files.</li>
        <li><strong>Connection Quality:</strong> Transfer speeds and reliability depend on peer network conditions. We are not responsible for slow transfers, connection drops, or failed transfers due to network issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>14. Reporting Violations</h2>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>False Reports:</strong> Submitting knowingly false or malicious reports may result in your access being terminated.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Open Source and Transparency</h2>
